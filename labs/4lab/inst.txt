 For this lab you will be creating a simple guessing game in which the human player has to guess the computer's 
 randomly generated number. Additionally, when the player finally guesses correctly the computer tells them how 
 many guesses it took.

The basic steps of the program are:

    1) The computer generates a random number in the range 1-100 inclusive (including 1 and 100).
    2) The computer sets a counter variable to 0.
    3) The human player guesses the number.
    4) The program increments the guess counter.
    5) If the guess is wrong:
        a) The computer tells the player if their guess was too low or too high.
        b) The program loops back to step 3)
    If the guess is correct the program stops looping.
    5) The program tells the user they guessed right and how many guesses it took. (This is after the loop, 
        so the player must have guessed right.)


variables
    counter
    correct guess or not loop variable
    random number
    players number guess

setup

main()
    counter = 0
    generate random number
    correct guess or not loop variable = true
    gameOn()
        have player guess
            store guess
        if correct
             end 
         else 
            if(guess>number)
                tell them too high
                incremnt 
            else
                too low
                incremnt
