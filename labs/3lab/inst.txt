For this lab you will be modifying the simple calculator program that you wrote for Assignment 2. 
Please review that assignment for the full requirements of that program. You should use your calculator 
program for this lab, but if you didn't complete Assignment 2 use this code.


To complete the lab make the following modifications to the calculator program:

    When the user enters their choice for the calculator operation (+, -, *, or /) 
    it should be a number between 1 and 4 (or 0 and 3). In the original version of the program 
    if the user entered an illegal value no operation was performed. Modify the program so that anytime the user 
    enters an illegal operation an error message is printed and the user is asked for a new value. This will 
    require adding a loop whose condition is based on the user's choice.

    In the initial version of the program it would perform one operation and then exit. Change the program so that when 
    it finishes a calculation it asks the user if they want to perform another calculation. You can have the user enter a 
    0 for no and 1 for yes, or use a char so they can enter n or y.

    Extra Credit: Add an additional calculation to the calculator. This calculation should sum all of the integers between 
    the two numbers the user entered (truncating the numbers if the user entered a decimal). For example, if the user 
    entered 5.2 and 8.7 then the calculator should sum all of the values between 5 and 8 (i.e. 5 + 6 + 7 + 8). Remember
    that if you store a double value in an int variable it is automatically truncated.
