Part one hypothesize whether each of the Boolean statements 
and mathematical expressions given below is true or false. 
Write your hypotheses in a file that can be printed in lab 
(or emailed to the TA if that is the TA's preference). 
You will not be graded on whether you get these right or 
wrong, but you do need to turn them in.

Consider which expressions were the most difficult 
to understand. Create 3 more of your own expressions 
to try to clarify how Boolean and Mathematical expressions 
are evaluated in C/C++. Add these expressions along with 
your hypotheses about their values to the list given below 
(for a total of 23 expressions).

Part 2 write a program to determine whether the Boolean 
statements and mathematical expressions given below, plus
the three that you created, are true or false. Remember 
that C++ (and C) use a 1 for true and a 0 for false. 
Thus, to determine the validity of a Boolean statement 
you only need to embed it in a cout statement. For example,
the command:
cout << (7 < 9) || (4 < 0) << endl;
will print 1 if the statement is true and 0 if the 
statement is false.

To determine is a mathematical expression is 
treated as true or false an if-else statement can be used.
For example, to determine whether the expression: 5*6 - 30 
treated as true or false you can use the code:
if(5*6 -30){
    cout << "It's true\n";
} else {
    cout << "It's false\n";
}

Make sure you can print and turn in the results from your
program as well as the program itself. (Remember to use 
the script command to create a printable output file. 
The command script lab2output will create a file called 
lab2output that you can print.

Part three use the results of the program to mark on
your original file containing your hypotheses which 
hypotheses were correct and which ones were incorrect.
