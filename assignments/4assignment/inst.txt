 For this assignment you will be modifying the NIM game from the text. the code is also posted on the course scehdule. 
 Make the following changes:




    (Chapter 3, Problem 1) Remove the "magic" numbers from the code. There's nothing particularly special about the 
    limit of removing 3 objects. Changing the rules to a different number of objects requires changing the conditions 
    of the loops that control what is a valid move, and the rand() statement so that the computer picks a number in the 
    correct, new range. The best way to do this is to replace the current "magic" numbers (1 and 3) with variables. This 
    makes the code easier to read (assuming the variables are given meaningful names like minimum move and maximum move)
    and makes the code easier to change in the future because only the two new variables need to be changed.

    (Chapter 3, Problem 4) Have the computer print a row of symbols, like #'s or *'s, to represent the number of objects 
    remaining. This requires a loop that prints num objects of the symbols in a row. A for loop, described in Section A.3 
    of Appendix A and in Chapter 5, works well, although a do-while loop can also be made to work. (A do-while loop 
    requiresw variable that "counts" from 1 to num objects as part of the loop.)

    (Chapter 3, Exercise 7) Modify the program to play multiple games in a row without having to 
    restart the program each time. After each individual game the program should ask the player 
    if they want to play again. If the player chooses to play again then the program should loop back to the beginning.
